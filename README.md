# VeiLink
VeiLink is a simple and efficient bash script designed for URL masking. It allows users to combine a phishing URL with an original URL, creating a masked link that appears legitimate.

# Installation
pkg install git -y

pkg install python -y

git clone https://github.com/Anonycodexia/VeiLink

cd VeiLink

bash veilink.sh

# Note
It'll be really more useful if you use it with a URL Shortner service. I mean you should first Shorten your malicious url and then enter it in the VeiLink.

# Happy Hacking ðŸ¥²
